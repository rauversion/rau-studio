# Rekordbox Convert

Rekordbox Convert imports a Rekordbox XML export, lets the user select playlists, converts the required audio files to AIFF, and exports a new XML with safe `Location` replacements.

## Workflow

1. Export a library or playlist set from Rekordbox as XML.
2. Open **File Conversion > Rekordbox Convert** in Rau Studio.
3. Import the XML. Rau Studio also adds it automatically to the unified Playlist Library.
4. Review playlists, tracks, converted files, the conversion plan, and the report.
5. Select one or more playlists.
6. Create a plan if you want to run a preflight first.
7. Convert by row, by active playlist, or by multiple selected playlists.
8. Watch the fixed terminal for `ffmpeg` progress and errors.
9. Export a new XML.
10. Import the exported XML into Rekordbox.

## Unified Playlist Library

Every XML opened in Rekordbox Convert is indexed automatically in a single collection. Importing
another XML adds its playlists to that collection instead of creating another source that must be
selected manually.

Tracks are deduplicated primarily by their normalized local file path. When a file path is not
available, Rau Studio uses its identifying metadata. If the same playlist path appears in more than
one XML, its memberships are merged and repeated tracks are kept only once. Reimporting an XML
updates that source without duplicating its tracks or playlist memberships.

Editable playlists are also presented as one centralized list throughout Playlist Library,
Catalog, Taxonomy, Copilot, and File Conversion. The shared add dialog can target any existing
playlist or create a new one. When source and destination come from different indexed libraries,
Rau Studio copies the track reference safely and deduplicates it by audio path.

## Safe XML Export

The original XML is never modified. Rau Studio writes a new XML with a suggested suffix:

```text
original.rau-studio.aiff.xml
```

The exported XML keeps the full collection from the original XML:

- tracks that were not converted keep their original `Location`;
- converted tracks point to the AIFF file inside `converted/`;
- playlists and folder structure are preserved.

If required conversions are missing or blocking issues exist, the app reports the problem before writing an ambiguous export.

## AIFF Conversion

Conversion uses `ffmpeg` with a conservative compatibility profile:

- AIFF container;
- `pcm_s16be`;
- 44.1 kHz;
- stereo;
- embedded text metadata copied from the source into ID3v2.3 tags;
- no overwrite.

Original files are not replaced.

```text
/Music/Artist/Track.flac
/Music/Artist/converted/Track.aiff
```

## Plan

The **Create Plan** button runs a preflight. It does not convert files and it does not export XML.

The plan helps review:

- tracks that will be converted;
- tracks that are already AIFF;
- existing converted AIFF files that can be reused;
- missing files;
- unsupported formats;
- blocking issues before export.

## Interface

- Scrollable playlist sidebar with selection, processing indicators, and converted counters.
- Track table for the active playlist.
- Row-level player and actions.
- Tabs for playlist files, converted files, plan, and report.
- Fixed expandable terminal for conversion and export logs.
- Controlled concurrency selector.
